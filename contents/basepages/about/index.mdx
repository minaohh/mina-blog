She co-founded [WeSoarHigh](https://wesoarhigh.com), a matching platform that helps businesses find freelance developers they can trust. As a Technical Lead Engineer, she leads culturally diverse and cross-functional teams, product releases and manages sprints. A consistent learner, she regularly reads non-fiction and Business books, furthers her knowledge through taking online classes (MOOCs), teaching Mobile Development part-time at a University, tutoring part-time, creating video tutorials ([CodeBlink Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDWFOP8hHKW0yef8q2RmS2Q)), and, in the past, taking part-time work on her startup, SevTech Inc.

Passionate, goal-oriented, proactive, highly organized, and tremendously driven, she adds value to organizations, businesses, and students alike.
