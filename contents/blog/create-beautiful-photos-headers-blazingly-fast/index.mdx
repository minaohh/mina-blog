I loved how my social media profile looks! My Twitter header is engaging and has a value proposition for my followers (and potential followers). Both my header and photo have a matching background color too, making them more appealing and easier on the eyes.

## Why is this important?

Profile pictures on social media represent an image of you that you would want others to see in yourself -- are you serious (formal photo), laid-back (beach or "chill" photos), adventurous (photo of you doing daring activities), quirky ("wacky" photo), artistic (creative shot), or tech-savvy What if the platform calls for formal shots?

Photos with edited background photos to the rescue! Changing the background of your photo gives you more options — you can literally pick any photo you want for any setting. This flexibility helps you with personal branding.

Headers or banners, on the other hand, supplement your profile by giving your visitors the highlights and setting their expectations. This helps you control the narrative and even promote your businesses and side hustles.

Together, they can contribute to the quantity and quality of your followers, ensuring those who choose to do it sees value in your profile and the content you share.

When designing anything -- from website and mobile apps to creative content-- this website is my absolute go-to. Personally, I'm not a designer so I don't have the "eye", the creativity of knowing which colors work well with one another. This website makes up for it.

With this site, I select the color I'm most drawn to, and apply that to the background of both my social media header and profile picture.

### [Remove.bg](http://remove.bg)

Remove the background from your photos at [Remove.bg](http://remove.bg).

Tool: **Free + Subscription plan**

When I found this tool on [ProductHunt](http://producthunt.com/) over a year ago, I stopped asking my brother to photoshop my photos. Because of it, I can now use casual, more flattering shots as a display picture on platforms that call for formal photos.

In my current Twitter photo, for example, I was actually under a shade, sitting on a monoblock chair, in a popular tourist spot in the Philippines. Thanks to [remove.bg](http://remove.bg/), I use that photo in the office and on my social media accounts.
