<span class="subtitle">How personal projects kept the stress away in this trying time</span>

No one could have ever predicted that their lives will be turned upside down in
2020 — all of our plans are effectively canceled.

As a _self-proclaimed_ control freak who has a plan or a list for every hour of
her life, **I see canceled plans at this scale as a major pain point.** <br> Of
course, there is more to this crisis than the disruption of the old “normal”,
but I won’t get into anything morbid or depressing here — we’ve had enough of
that.

Everyone deals with stress differently. Some signed up on _TikTok_, or scrolled
endlessly on social media, or binged watched (i.e. KDramas) on streaming
platforms.

**I buried myself in personal projects**. 👩🏻‍💻 **It was only when I stopped
working that I felt the pang of sadness**, which is perfectly normal when in
crisis mode.

So, in the first month of the [Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) in the
Philippines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Luzon_enhanced_community_quarantine)
🇵🇭, my partner and I created the following products, keeping our minds
preoccupied, and our days consistently productive.

<br/>

## Project #1: ProductiveAtHome.club

[ProductiveAtHome](http://productiveathome.club) 🧠 is my passion project. I’ve
had this idea since late last year — **a platform where people can share their
knowledge and learn something new interactively for free**.

My partner and I launched 🚀 our site last April 16, in time for [ProductHunt’s
Makers Festival (WFH)](https://www.producthunt.com/makers-festival/wfh), and
[posted on ProductHunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/productive-at-home)
last April 19.

😂*Funny story*: I posted the wrong link on my submission for PH’s _Makers
Festival_. If you look for [ProductiveAtHome](http://productiveathome.club)
[here](https://www.producthunt.com/makers-festival/wfh/voting) and click on the
link, it will show nothing because of a typo 😅 on the link. There’s a ‘_t_’
before “https”. 🤦‍♀️

I was so excited to launch [ProductiveAtHome](http://productiveathome.club) 🧠,
to share “my baby” to the world, I couldn’t sleep. That excitement helped me see
this project through to completion.

## Project #2: Fakepatrol.app

## How working on personal projects helped me cope

Here are the three ways working on this project helped keep my sanity and
positivity intact.

### #1: Going offline most of the time kept the negativity away 💁🏻‍♀️

<span class="figcaption_hack">Living life offline</span>

Keen to launch as soon as possible, we had to work on this for 2 weeks straight
on top of our day jobs. We didn’t have time to scroll mindlessly on social
media, where stress and negativity thrived. We had to _disconnect_.

**Out of sight, out of mind.** With this form of detachment, I only allowed
myself a 15-minute-maximum online time to check COVID stats and skim current
events. The rest, I deemed as mere unnecessary distractions from the goal —
product launch 🚀.

Sometimes, ignorance is bliss. And that’s okay. **It’s always okay to protect
your mental health.**

### #2: To “begin with the end in mind” is to leave little room for distractions 🙈

On top of disconnecting from social media, we limited our time on streaming
platforms like _Netflix_. Because other than completing the project, we didn’t
give anything else (except our day jobs, of course) the time of day.

Trust me, **when you are so focused on your goals, you will do everything in
your power to achieve them**. So, eliminating these distractions weren’t
difficult.

### #3: Hitting milestones and building products meant ending the day satisfied 😌

There is no doubt that [happiness affects
productivity](https://www.knowmail.me/blog/productivity-affect-happiness/). And
I was in a productive loop

<br>

## Conclusion

Throughout the first month of the ECQ, I kept myself busy 🐝 by devoting most of
my time to developing products. Such tenacity and determination gave birth to 2
products: [ProductiveAtHome](http://productiveathome.club) and
[FakePatrol](http://fakepatrol.app).

> The products themselves were a constructive distraction from the harsh reality
> that nothing will ever be the same again — this is the new “normal”.

### Find your own “sanity project”

A _sanity project_ is any activity that helps you keep your sanity.

**The best way for all of us to cope with the global crisis that is COVID-19 is to keep busy**
— sign up for classes, host video calls, talk to your friends and
family, minimize your time on social media, dance on TikTok, watch movies &
series, volunteer, donate (time or money, you choose), exercise, do yoga, etc.

**My personal projects are what kept me sane and happy.**

1.  Do something productive ✅ every day, but always leave room for downtimes.
1.  Don’t try to do everything at once. 🏋🏻‍♂️💃🏻📚🏓🎹🎨🎸🎮
1.  Focus 👁 on one thing at a time.

**Keep sane and stay at home. I know we will get through this**, we just have to
be patient. 😊
